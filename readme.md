An attempt to create a C++ single header library that allows hot loading of variables from a custom file format.

## Motivation?

I've been doing a lot of opengl stuff, and one of the things that annoys me is having to recompile the whole project when you change values like light intensity or colors etc.
With this solution I will be able to control the values of different variables at runtime by modifying the values in the config file.
